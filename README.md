### Description

The ‚ÄòColor Theory for Developers‚Äô Playground Book was born from a simple idea: building a bridge between designers and developers. How did I come up with that? I‚Äôm actually both a designer and a developer (at heart) and I noticed a real struggle and misunderstanding between these two mindsets. I also noticed that, to a UI/UX designer is required a basic knowledge about code, so I thought about counterpart, a notion that a developer would need, and that was color theory, especially how to use that in UI interfaces. Ideally, this Playground Book is handed over to a developer by a designer and does its job letting the user interact with the given notion.

### Used Technologies

The main framework used in this playground, besides PlaygroundSupport, is SpriteKit. For the animations of the Introduction and End cutscenes I used Tumult Hype and designed from scratch all the assets. The book is divided, besides introduction and ending, in four pages: let‚Äôs see in depth the features and technologies used.

Let me know what you think of it! ‚ú®
